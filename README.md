# Rider Resume

## Status

The site is still heavily under development. School has picked up so I've been doing less work on this side project of mine.

## Description

Rider Resume is a site to aid IBA Members in tracking what rides they have done and what other rides they may have qualified for. It also provides some interesting stats for the entered rides.

## Usage

Once the site is live, a link will be placed here.
